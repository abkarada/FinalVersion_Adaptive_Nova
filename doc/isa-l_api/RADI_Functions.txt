--RAID Functions--
Functions in the RAID section calculate and operate on XOR and P+Q parity
found in common RAID impelementations.

Find one or two parity bytes for each byte in N sources such that single 
or dual disk failures(one or two erasures) can be corrected.

For RAID5, a block of parity is calculated by the xor across the N source arrays.
Each parity byte is calculated from N sources by:

P = D0 + D1 + ...+D(N-1)

xor_gen()

int xor_gen (
int vects,
int len,
void ∗∗ array )

xor_check()

int xor_check (
int vects,
int len,
void ∗∗ array )
