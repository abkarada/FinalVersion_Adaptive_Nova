--Erasure Code Functions--
Functions pertaining to erasure codes implement a general Reed-Solomon type 
encoding for blocks of data to protect
against erasure of whole blocks. Individual operations can be described in
terms of arithmetic in the Galois finite field
GF(2∧8) with the particular field-defining primitive or reducing polynomial:

x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1(0x1d)

ec_encode_data():

void ec_encode_data(
		int len,
		int k,
		int rows,
		unsigned char *gftbls,
		unsigned char **data,
		unsigned char **coding
)

len: Length of each block of data(vector) of source or dest data.
k: The number of vector sources or rows in the generator matrix for coding.
rows: The number of output vectors to concurrently encode/decode.

ec_init_tables()

void ec_init_tables(
	int k,
	int rows,
	unsigned char *a,
	unsigned char *gftbls)

Initialize tables for fast Erasure Code encode and decode.
Generates the expanded tables needed for fast encode or decode
for erasure codes on blocks of data. 32bytes is
generated for each input coefficient.

k: The number of vector sources or rows in the generator matrix for coding.
rows: The number of output vectors to concurrently encode/decode.
a:Pointer to sets of arrays of input coefficients used to encode or decode data.
gftbls: Pointer to start of space for concatenated output tables generated from
input coefficients. Must be of size
32∗k∗rows.
